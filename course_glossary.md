 ## What is Servlet?
 - A servlet is a Javaâ„¢ technology-based Web component, managed by a container, that generates dynamic content. Like other Java technology-based components, servlets are platform-independent Java classes that are compiled to platform-neutral bytecode that can be loaded dynamically into and run by a Java technology-enabled Webserver. Containers, sometimes called servlet engines, are Web server extensions that provide servlet functionality. 
 Servlets interact with Web clients via arequest/response paradigm implemented by the servlet container.
