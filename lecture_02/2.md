# Servlet API Examples

During the lesson the examples of registration of servlets is done. 
The demo application is in separate repository.

[Simple Servlet Demo App](https://github.com/sohlich/servlet-api-simple-app)

## Covers:
- servlet and filter registration via web.xml,annotation and ServletContext object.
- simple request handling


## Proposed project based on lesson topic

The proposed project is the simple application that uses the JWT 
for user authentication and authorization. (Picture from JWT.io page)
For our purpose we use the cookie as token storage, 
to avoid the header handling on the client side with JS.

To handle the cookie see:
[Cookie docs from API](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setMaxAge-int-)

The pages could be generated with Freemaker template engine:

As the JWT implementation you can use:
[JWT.io](https://github.com/auth0/java-jwt)
